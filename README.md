# 🧠 Astra

**Astra** is an AI-powered operations and secretary assistant designed for small software development teams. It streamlines planning, meetings, follow-ups, and organizational memory using production-grade LLM system design principles.

This project is developed alongside and is inspired by: [*The LLM Engineer's Handbook*](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072).

## 📘 Inspiration & Credit

This project is built while reading and applying ideas from:

**The LLM Engineer's Handbook**  
*by Paul Iusztin & Maxime Labonne*

Astra follows similar high-level architectural principles as the book's **LLM Twin** project, but adapted from personal data management to team operations and workflows.
